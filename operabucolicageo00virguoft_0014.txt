viii VIRGIL

himself is said to have written to him from Spain (mc.
27) encouraging him to publish the poem, which he
was known to have in hand, and which Propertius a
year or two later heralds as ‘ something greater than the
Iliad.’1 While he was engaged on its composition in
B.c. 23, MarcelluS, the nephew and destined heir of
Augustus, died, and Virgil introduced into the sixth
Book the famous passage (860-887) in which he is
described, and of which the story is told that when the
poet recited it in the presence of Octavia, the bereaved
mother fainted away.2 In B.c. 20 he visited Greece
and met AugustUS‚ who was returning from Samos, at
Athens, whence he accompanied him homewards, but
his health, which had been long weak, broke down, and
he died at Brundisium Sept. 22, B.c. 19.

He was buried at Naples on the road which leads to
Puteoli. The inscription said to have been inscribed
on his tomb refers to the places of his birth, death, and
burial‚ and to the subjects of his three great works :

Mantua me genuit, Calabri rapuere, tenet nunc
Parthenope .· cecini pascua, rura, duces.

Virgil was largely read in his own day, and his
works, like those of Horace, at once became a standard
text-book in schools,3 and were commented on by
numerous critics and grammarians‚ of whom Aulus

Gellius in the second century and Macrobius and
