colonists of Sicily. The Idst, however, differ from
the Eclogues in a marked manner. They are true to
nature 3 the scenery is real ; the shepherds are ‘beings

(containing in all 2184 lines), of which the First deals
with husbandry proper, the Second with the rearing of

of Alexandria, and from the Θηριακά of Nicander.
