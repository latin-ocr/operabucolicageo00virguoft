WRJTTEN AT THE REQUEST oF THE MANTUANS FOR Tm:
NINETEENTH CENTENARY OF VIRG1L⁷S DEATH.

1

Roman Virgil, thou that singest

Ilion’s lof‘cy temples robed in fire,
Ilion falling, Rome arising,

wars, and filial saith, and Dido’s pyre3

11

Landscape·lover, lord of language

more than he that sang the Works and Days,
All the chosen coin of fancy

flashing out from many a golden phrase3

111

Thou that singest wheat and woodland,
tilth and vineyard‚ hive and horse and herd ;

An the charm of all the Muses
often flowering in a lonely word3

IV

Poet of the happy Tityrus
piping underneath his beechen bowers;
Poet of the poet-satyr
whom the laughing shepherd bound with fiowers5

V

Chanter of the Pollio, glorying
in the blissful years again to be,
Summers of the snakeless meadow,
unlaborious earth and oarless sea3

VI

Thou that seEst Universal

Nature moved by Universal Mind3
Thou majestic in thy sadness

at the doubtful doom of human kind3
