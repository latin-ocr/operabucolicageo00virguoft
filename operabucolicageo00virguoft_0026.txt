xx VIRGIL

and John Milton are to be compared. As we pass with
him into the under world, by the sole force of genius
he makes a dream seem to us a living fact-3 he corn-
mands our thoughts to follow whithersoever he leads
them, and they obey3 under his guidance we tread
with ghostly but unhesitating footsteps that dim and
unknown highway which extends beyond the grave.

For an ordinary man, however, to criticise Virgil is
almost an impertinence. It needs a poet to appreciate
a poet, and the judgment of Alfred Tennyson outweighs
that of a host of critics and commentators. There
could be no more just and happy tribute from one
master to another than the following Ode addressed
by the English to the Roman Virgil.1
