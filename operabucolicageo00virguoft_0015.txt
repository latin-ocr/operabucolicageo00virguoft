early Christians in the belief, still unquestioned in the
days of Pope‚1 that the fourth Eclogue contained a
prophecy of Christ, looked upon him almost with
reverence, and it is not merely as the greatest of Italian
singers, but also as something of a saint, that Dante

his Eclogues professedly imitates Theocritus, in his
Georgics Hesiod, and in the Aeneid Homer. The
