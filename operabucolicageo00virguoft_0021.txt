destined to become great Romans and describes their
future fortunes, after which Aeneas returns safely to
the upper air.

Books VIL-XH. describe how Aeneas allied himself
with Latinus, king of the Latins, and received the
promise of the hand of his daughter Lavinia, and how
Turnus, king of the Rutuli, a former suitor for Lavinia's
hand, opposed him, but was at last defeated and slain.

The Aeneid, it will thus be seen, is a sort of national
epic intended to connect the origin of the Romans (and
especially of the Julian family) with the gods and heroes
of Homeric song, and incidentally serving to dignify
many Roman customs and ceremonies by identifying
them with the customs and ceremonies of the heroic
age. At the same time Aeneas and his followers, as
through difficulties and dangers, putting their trust
in heaven, they steadily press forward to success, afford
a visible personification of those virtues which had
slowly and surely secured for Rome the empire of the
world, while Aeneas himself ‘as a fatherly ruler over
his people, their chief in battle, their law-giver in
peace, and their high-priest in all spiritual relations,’1
is clearly a type of Augustus, the founder of the new
monarchy.2

As a story of war and adventure the Aeneid cannot
compete in freshness and life with the Iliad and the
Odyssey. It could hardly do so, Between the bard
who chants the ‘glory of heroes' at the feasts of

1 Sellar's virgil, p. 344.

2 Nor is it unreasonable to see in Dido a type of those seductive
charms coupled with unfeminine ambition which the Romans
dreaded and detested in Cleopatra.
