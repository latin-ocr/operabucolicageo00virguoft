VIRGIL

vn
Light among the vanish'd ages ;
star that gildest yet this phantom shore 5
Golden branch amid the shadows,
kings and realms that pass to rise no more 3

V111

Now thy Forum roars no longer,

fallen every purple Caesar's dome—
Tho' thine ocean-roll of rhythm

sound for ever of Imperial Rome—-

lx>

Now the Rome of slaves hath perish'd‚
and the Rome of freemen holds her place,
I, from out the Northern Island

sunder’d once from all the human race,

I salute thee, Mantovano‚

I that loved thee since my day began,
‘Wielder of the stateliest measure

ever moulded by the lips of man.
