unmoved by his own genius, and begins the next
paragraph quite placidly at pius Aeneas . . . ! How
the man who wrote the lines placed in Dido’s mouth
could immediately afterwards speak of ‘ the good Aeneas
etc.’ is one of the puzzles of literature, and even the
fact that the Aeneid was never finished does not
