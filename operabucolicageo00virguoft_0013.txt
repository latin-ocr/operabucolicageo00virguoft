INTRODUCTION vii

From this time Virgil lived at Rome or Naples
enjoying the bounty and friendship of the Emperor
and forming part of the select circle of distinguished
men, which his minister Maecenas—the great literary
patron of the day—gathered round him in his mansion
on the Esquiline. It was at the request of Maecenas1
that he composed the four Books of the Georgic5‚
written between 37 13.c. and 30 B.c., and dedicated to
him.2 We know little of his life, but it was he who
introduced Horace to Maecenas,3' and in Horace’s
writings we catch an occasional glimpse of him,
notably in the description of the famous ‘journey
to Brundisium,' when he joined the party of Maecenas
at Sinuessa, and, along with Plotius and Varius, is
classed by his brother-poet in a memorable phrase
among ‘the fairest souls and dearest friends on earth,'4
While on another occasion Horace makes his starting
for a tour in Greece the occasion for an Ode, in which
he prays that the ship which bears so dear a trust may
restore it safe to the shores of Italy, ‘ and preserve the
ι half of my life.'5

In the opening lines of the third Georgic Virgil had
already announced his intention of attempting a loftier
theme and producing a great national epic‚ of which
Augustus should be the central figure, and the Emperor ,

1 Georg. 3. 41.
² Georg. 1. 2.
3 Hor. Sat. 1. 6. 54. optimus olim Ι Vergilius, post bunc Varius dixere

quid essem.

4 sat. 1. 5. 41 animae, quales neque candidiores Ι terra tulit neque
quis me sit devinctior alter.

⁵ od. 1. 3. 8 et serves animae dimidium meae. Those who choose
can suppose that there were two Virgils thus dear to Horace.
