xii VIRGIL

consists of a quantity of short sententious precepts
thrown into a poetic form. Such poetry is called
‘didactic' because its aim is to convey instruction.
In early ageS‚ when writing is unknown or little used,
proverbs and precepts are naturally cast into a poetic
mould for the simple reason that they are thus rendered
less liable to alteration and more easy of recollection.1
Even when prose writing has become common a phil-
osopher or a preacher may endeavour to render his ’
subject more attractive by clothing it in poetic dress,2
and shortly before Virgil began to write Lucretius had
so embodied the philosophie system of Epicurus in his
De Rerum Natura. That splendid poem was constantly
in Virgil’s mind when he wrote the Georgics, but,
though he found in Lucretius a source of inspiration
and in Hesiod a model, he differs widely from them
both. Hesiod wrote didactic poetry because in his day
it was practically useful, Lucretius wrote it in the
interests of what he believed to be philosophical
truth ; Virgil's object is on the other hand not
primarily to instruct but to please. What he writes
is excellent sense, for he thoroughly understood his
subject, and his love for agriculture and the ‘divine
country' is undoubtedly genuine, but he writes to
gratify the artistic and literary tastes of his readers
and not with any practical aim. The characteristic
indeed of the Georgics is their consummate art. They
are written with slow3 and elaborate care. Each line
